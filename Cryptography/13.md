# 13
---
The questions tells about ROT13 and gives the text cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}\
on searching about ROT13 I got to know that it shifts each alphabet by 13\
and by putting the text in the rot13 decoder I got the flag\
![image](https://github.com/Bg652/ctf/assets/144695497/9803e76d-3aac-49bb-9f07-77e1dda0be06)\
and the flag found is picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}.
